🛍️ Tata Data Visualization Internship – Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals
📊 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Tata Data Visualization Internship Program.
The goal was to create a set of effective visuals that provide valuable insights for the CEO and CMO of an online retail company, using Power BI.

The analysis focuses on revenue trends, top-performing markets, key customers, and regional product demand to help guide the company’s forecasting and expansion strategy.

🧹 Data Cleaning

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned in Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Cleaning steps included:

✅ Removing transactions where Quantity < 1 (store returns).

✅ Removing records where UnitPrice ≤ 0 (data entry errors).

✅ Creating a calculated Revenue column:

Revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice


✅ Verified data integrity before loading into Power BI visuals.
