# E-commerce SQL Analytics Project

This project analyzes e-commerce sales performance using advanced SQL techniques:
- Window Functions
- CTEs
- CASE Statements
- Joins
- Data Cleansing

### 📊 Datasets Used
- `gold.fact_sales`: Transactional sales data  
- `gold.dim_customers`: Customer demographic data  
- `gold.dim_products`: Product and category data  

### ⚙️ Tools
- SQL (MySQL 8.0+)

### 💡 What’s Inside
Each `.sql` file answers a different analytical question like:
1. Monthly Sales & Customer Metrics  
2. Yearly Product Performance  
3. Category Contribution  
4. Customer Segmentation  
... and more!

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench or DBeaver  
2. Make sure your tables (`gold.fact_sales`, etc.) exist  
3. Run each file inside the `sql/` folder to get insights
