# ðŸŽ¬ Python Movie Correlation Project

## Overview
This project analyzes **6,820 movies** from **1986â€“2016** to explore correlations between movie attributes such as **budget, gross revenue, runtime, IMDb score, and votes**.  
The goal is to uncover trends in the movie industry and identify factors that influence **revenue** and **ratings**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / IMDb  
- **Location in repo:** `data/movies.csv`

**Columns include:**

| Column   | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| budget   | Movie budget (some missing values) |
| gross    | Revenue generated |
| company  | Production company |
| country  | Country of origin |
| director | Movie director |
| genre    | Main genre |
| name     | Movie title |

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handled missing values, formatted dates, and replaced zeros in `budget` and `gross`.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Explored distributions, outliers, and trends in the dataset.  
3. **Correlation Analysis** â€“ Computed correlations between numeric attributes to understand relationships.  
4. **Visualizations** â€“ Created scatter plots, heatmaps, and trend charts to illustrate findings.  
5. **Insights** â€“ Interpreted correlations and industry trends based on analysis.
